TEST PLAN: IDS + Sender + Receiver (Spam Attack)
Goal: Show that your IDS detects normal packets and flood packets.
 STEP 1 — Flash all 3 Micro:bits
Micro:bit #1 — Sender

Flash your normal sender firmware:

AES_sender.hex

Micro:bit #2 — Receiver

Flash your receiver firmware:

AES_reciever.hex

Micro:bit #3 — IDS

Flash your new IDS firmware:

MICROBIT.hex   (the one built today)

 STEP 2 — Power all Micro:bits

After flashing, just power them all on:

Sender shows whatever your group programmed

Receiver waits for encrypted packets

IDS scrolls “IDS” and waits silently

This means all 3 devices are ready.

 STEP 3 — Test NORMAL traffic (baseline)

Press the send button on the Sender (usually button A).

Receiver should react (show decrypted LED pattern).

IDS should blink a little dot:

.


Repeat a few times:

Sender → sends packet

Receiver → displays

IDS → prints .

This confirms radio group is correct and the system is working.

 STEP 4 — Test FLOOD / SPAM attack
Method: Hold the Sender Button

 “Hold down button B and don’t release.”

What happens:

On Sender

It keeps sending packets rapidly.

On Receiver

Packets will arrive too fast — maybe laggy or skipping.

On IDS

You should see:

F   F   F


or a flashing F multiple times.

This means:

Packet rate > FLOOD_THRESHOLD

IDS is successfully detecting a flood attack

This is your main test result 

Ask one teammate to take a picture or video — perfect for the report.

 STEP 5 — Observe Serial Log (optional but good for report)

Connect IDS Micro:bit to laptop with USB.

Open a serial terminal:

minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0


or

screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200


During normal presses you will see lines like:

pkt=5 len=17 sus=0 flood=0
pkt=6 len=17 sus=0 flood=0


During flood:

pkt=52 len=17 sus=1 flood=1
pkt=53 len=17 sus=1 flood=1
